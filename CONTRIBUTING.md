## Bug reports

[File an issue](https://github.com/theodorejb/es-cookie/issues) with a reproducable example of the problem.

## Testing

After cloning the repository, run `npm install && npm run prepublish && npm start`.
Then open a browser to http://localhost:8080/test/browser/ to execute the tests.

After making code changes, run `npm run prepublish` in a separate console window before refreshing the browser to ensure all tests still pass.
